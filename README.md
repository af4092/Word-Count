# Word-Count
Following api takes text as an input and displays the count of word.

Program counts the occurrences of words in a text and displays the words and their occurrences in alphabetical order of the words. The program uses a TreeMap to store an entry consisting of a word and its count. For each word, check whether it is already a key in the map. If not, add an entry to the map with the word as the key and value 1. Otherwise, increase the value for the word (key) by 1 in the map. Assume the words are case insensitive; e.g., 'Boy' is treated the same as 'boy'
